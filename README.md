# Smart-water
**The mobile app for company Oras Group that helps people care about water with benefit to planet and themself. **

### PROBLEMATICS
Global risks from overuse and shortage, poor water infrastructure and management came out on top. Many people don't think twice or it's just hard for them **to keep track of saving water every day**.

We want to **motivate people** to preserve it and visualize their daily actions that **affect the environment.**
